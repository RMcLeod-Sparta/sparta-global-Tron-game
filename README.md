  * Overcame first hurdle of making a game area of 500 pixels wide and tall by adding "px" to the end of my current measurements. 
  * Next sprint was mostly spent getting the collisons to work. I did this by changing the function of the player to add their class to the element they are in where as the trail replaces all classes with its own. This means that the game is checking for any td to have both the bike class and the trail class to execute the appropriate end game code.
  * Having this functionality made it easy to tell which player wins just by the tag comparison.
