# Nort
<ol>
  <li>I first researched how to make a tron style game but came up with not a
  lot of examples that did not use the canvas. So I decided to use a snake game
  example as the basis for my game but highly modify some of the major gameplay features.</li>
  <li>After I had a moving player with working trail I set out to make collisons work.
  This was my hardest obstacle to overcome as I had to change many different aspects
  like the player having a trail that has a different class than them that replaces
  the classes of elements it collides with, where as the player add it's class
  too the elements so the code can do class a comparison to check if the player
  has collided with something. I used the JQuery plugin collisions to do this.</li>
  <li>After I had a working 2 player game I put the relevant code into functions
  and made players 3 and 4. I set the controls for these new players and made them
  visually distinct.</li>
  <li>Next I made the html page look much better by adding a background some
  instructions on how to play as well as some music to play when the game starts.</li>
  <li>Finally I added some functionality in the form of being able to choose the
  number of players in addition to being able to restart and pause the game without
  reloading the web page.</li>
